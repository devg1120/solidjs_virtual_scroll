## Overview

**Libra UI** is a component library for SolidJS.

This is not a component library in the traditional sense. It's not a package you install from npm and `import` from. Instead, you use the CLI to add components directly into your source code, giving you 100% ownership.

### Why this approach?

- **Full Ownership:** Components become part of your codebase. You can freely customize their styles and logic without wrestling with third-party abstractions.
- **Learn by Reading:** The internal implementation of components is not a black box. You can learn by reading the code directly.
- **No Unnecessary Dependencies:** You don't need to add the entire massive library to your `node_modules`. Pick and choose only what you need.

## Installation and Usage

You can easily set up Libra UI with its CLI tool.

### 1. Initialization

First, run the following command in your SolidJS project.
This will generate a configuration file (`libra.config.json`) and inject basic CSS variables into your stylesheet.

```bash
npx solid-libra-ui@latest init
```

### 2. Adding Components

Next, use the add command to add the components you need to your project. Any internal dependencies will be added automatically.

```bash
npx solid-libra-ui@latest add [component-name]

```

## Examples:

```bash

# Add a single button component
npx solid-libra-ui@latest add button

# Add multiple components at once
npx solid-libra-ui@latest add dialog input

```

### 3. Usage

When you add a component, its files will be created in the directory specified in libra.config.json (default: src/components/ui). From there, you can import and use it just like any other SolidJS component.

```TSX

import { Button } from "./components/ui/button";

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <div class="grid place-items-center h-screen">
      <Button onClick={() => alert("Hello Libra UI!")}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyPage;

```
